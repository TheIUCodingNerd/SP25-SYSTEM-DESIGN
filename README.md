# 🎓 Student Management System

## 📌 Overview
Hey everyone! This is my **Student Management System**, a web-based app designed to make student data management easier for schools. Instead of relying on spreadsheets or paper records, this system provides a simple way to track **grades, attendance, and student details** in one place. 

This repo includes all the code, setup instructions, and demo materials. The goal is to build a **secure, user-friendly, and scalable** system that helps teachers and administrators manage student information efficiently.
